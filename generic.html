								<h2>Goal</h2>
								<p>The primary goal of this group project is to design and develop a prosthetic robotic arm that can articulate at the elbow joint. Ideally, it must be capable of rotating 90 degrees to the left and right. It must also be able to move upwards and downwards. While motorisation is not required, it is a main consideration as the purpose is to create a basic functional prosthetic arm using 3D-printed gears that allow for a basic range of motion.</p>
								<p>The creation of the body and skeleton of the prosthetic arm will utilise a technique known as 3D printing. This is a process in which an object is created from a digital file. The process involves three main stages. The first stage involves the design of the digital artefact using computer software, such as Fusion360, to create a 3D representation of the joints in the prosthetic arm. In the second stage, the 3D model is split into horizontal layers that are adequate for printing. Stage three involves the 3D printer itself, a piece of hardware that uses these horizontal layers as instructions to print an object layer by layer using a special type of plastic.</p>
								<h2>Techniques involved</h2>
								<p>3D printing was chosen as it allows for the use of rapid prototyping, a fast way of changing the designs of any components without needing to use expensive tools because changes are often performed within the computer program instead of on physical materials. The chosen computer program for this project, Fusion 360, is programmed to handle intricate designs for objects like power tools, engines, and other complex machinery. Because of this, it is adequate for a set of gears within the prosthetic arm. This is also aided by Fusions support for Python and C++ scripts, allowing for an automated process of rendering premade gears with different sizes and eliminating manual work.</p>
								<p>3D printing has also proven to work well with 3D scanning, a technique that involves using specialised hardware to digitally scan an object into a computer rendering program. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), the 3D scanning method used in this project, involves laser emission from scanner hardware with millions of pulses per second. These laser beams strike the surface of a target object and the time it takes for the light to return to the scanner is measured. This is used to calculate distance between the scanner and the point of impact on the target object. These distances are combined with their horizontal and vertical angles to generate 3D representations of the target objects surface. 3D scanning was used to scan a human arm as an object file. This object file was then used as the base for the prosthetic arm and a reference for the internal mechanisms within Fusion 360.</p>
