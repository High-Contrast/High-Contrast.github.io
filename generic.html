								<h2>Goal</h2>
								<p>The primary goal of this group project is to design and develop a prosthetic robotic arm that can articulate at the elbow joint. Ideally, it must be capable of rotating 90 degrees to the left and right. It must also be able to move upwards and downwards. While motorisation is not required, it is a main consideration as the purpose is to create a basic functional prosthetic arm using 3D-printed gears that allow for a basic range of motion.</p>
								<p>The creation of the body and skeleton of the prosthetic arm will utilise a technique known as 3D printing. This is a process in which an object is created from a digital file. The process involves three main stages. The first stage involves the design of the digital artefact using computer software, such as Fusion360, to create a 3D representation of the joints in the prosthetic arm. In the second stage, the 3D model is split into horizontal layers that are adequate for printing. Stage three involves the 3D printer itself, a piece of hardware that uses these horizontal layers as instructions to print an object layer by layer using a special type of plastic.</p>
								<h2>Techniques involved</h2>
								<p>3D printing was chosen as it allows for the use of rapid prototyping, a fast way of changing the designs of any components without needing to use expensive tools because changes are often performed within the computer program instead of on physical materials. The chosen computer program for this project, Fusion 360, is programmed to handle intricate designs for objects like power tools, engines, and other complex machinery. Because of this, it is adequate for a set of gears within the prosthetic arm. This is also aided by Fusions support for Python and C++ scripts, allowing for an automated process of rendering premade gears with different sizes and eliminating manual work.</p>
								<p>3D printing has also proven to work well with 3D scanning, a technique that involves using specialised hardware to digitally scan an object into a computer rendering program. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), the 3D scanning method used in this project, involves laser emission from scanner hardware with millions of pulses per second. These laser beams strike the surface of a target object and the time it takes for the light to return to the scanner is measured. This is used to calculate distance between the scanner and the point of impact on the target object. These distances are combined with their horizontal and vertical angles to generate 3D representations of the target objects surface. 3D scanning was used to scan a human arm as an object file. This object file was then used as the base for the prosthetic arm and a reference for the internal mechanisms within Fusion 360.</p>

								<h2>Designing the moving parts</h2>
								<p>The arm was used as a base for several experimental gear mechanism designs. One of which was a small planetary gearbox system; a gearing containing three sets of gears that rotate around an inner and outer axis. This gearbox configuration is capable of high torque loads as the load is distributed across multiple inner gears, making it an ideal choice for use within a prosthetic arm that may be expected to handle heavy loads in day-to-day activities. However, these gearboxes are often noisy and slow. They also require more maintenance compared to simpler gearboxes, increasing both complexity and cost of the prosthetic.</p>
								<p>The final design was a simple elbow joint consisting of two smaller gears and two larger gear containers. This allowed for adequate freedom of movement while also being cost effective, less complex, and quieter.</p>

								<h2>3D printing</h2>
								<p>The type of 3D printing used to print the mechanisms was Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM), a process in which a special type of plastic filament is melted and then extruded from the nozzle of a 3D printer onto the printing surface. The melted filament is extruded as bead layers to eventually build up the solid objects. This type of 3D printing is designed to work with CAD files, making it simpler to use Fusion 360 to make CAD files of the physical components for use by the printer. Each component was printed separately, meaning they would need to be assembled after the printing process.</p>
								<span class="image"><img src="images/mechanism1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Unfortunately, this process of printing can only deliver simple manufacturing accuracy of the parts. In this case, the components were of low quality around the edges where the gears make contact. This can affect operation. Production times were also long, with prints taking multiple hours each. However, this form of printing was suitable for the prosthetic concept due to its low cost and reliability. Problems such as poor extrusion could be addressed with effective maintenance, the usage of a higher quality printer, and recalibration.</p>
